        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a skilled and versatile Game Developer, I possess hands-on experience in 3D modeling, gameplay programming, and asset integration within Unity and Unreal Engine. With a strong foundation in Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in Graphics and Gaming, I bring a robust blend of technical expertise and creative problem-solving to every project. My proficiency in using tools like Blender and Pixilart allows me to create high-quality 3D models for characters, environments, and props, tailored to meet the unique demands of various game styles and art directions.

            I am adept at working with both low-poly and high-poly models, ensuring optimized assets that contribute to smooth gameplay performance. My experience extends to texturing, rigging, and integrating these assets into game engines, resulting in immersive and engaging game worlds. As a developer, I have a strong command of C# and Blueprint scripting, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive gameplay experiences.
            
            I thrive in collaborative environments and am experienced in Agile methodologies, contributing effectively to team-driven projects while using version control systems like Git. Passionate about exploring new technologies and enhancing game performance, I am eager to bring my expertise to a dynamic team and create captivating, high-performance games.</p>
